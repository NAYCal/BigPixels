# Overview
This project aims to provide functionalities for performing basic tasks in computer vision and computational photography, focusing on ease of use. Most functions provided will be available for use with both Numpy and Torch data types. The hope is that this will not only be particularly helpful in creating more robust training sets for machine learning but also in furthering computer vision and computational photography work.
